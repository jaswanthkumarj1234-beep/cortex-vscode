**Your AI forgets everything between sessions. Cortex fixes that.**

Cortex gives AI coding assistants (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) persistent memory — so they remember your decisions, catch their own hallucinations, and never repeat the same mistakes twice.

## Why Cortex?

| Problem | How Cortex Solves It |
|---------|---------------------|
| AI forgets your architecture decisions | Stores decisions, conventions, and patterns permanently |
| AI hallucinates imports and file paths | `verify_code` and `verify_files` catch hallucinations before they ship |
| AI repeats the same bugs | Bug fixes and corrections are auto-recalled every session |
| New sessions start from zero context | 12-layer brain recall gives AI full project context in seconds |

---

## Features

### Zero-Install Server
Cortex bundles its own MCP server — **no `npm install` needed**. Just install the extension and it works.

### Sidebar Memory Browser
Browse all your memories organized by type: Decisions, Bug Fixes, Corrections, Conventions, and Insights.

### Smart Dashboard
A clean, responsive dashboard showing memory stats, quick actions, and memory breakdown with full light and dark mode support.

### 16 MCP Tools
| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `force_recall` | 12-layer brain recall at conversation start |
| `auto_learn` | Passively learns from every response |
| `recall_memory` | Hybrid FTS + vector search |
| `store_memory` | Store with quality gates and dedup |
| `verify_code` | Catch hallucinated imports and exports |
| `verify_files` | Catch hallucinated file paths |
| `scan_project` | Day-1 project understanding |
| `quick_store` | One-sentence memory store |
| + 8 more | export, import, update, delete, stats, health, context, list |

### Anti-Hallucination
Cortex checks AI-generated code against your real codebase:
- Are imported packages in `package.json`?
- Are imported functions actually exported?
- Are referenced env variables in `.env`?

### CodeLens Integration
See memory counts directly in your editor — know which files have related corrections, conventions, or insights.

### Inline Annotations
Corrections and conventions appear as subtle decorations right in your code.

### File Watcher
Get alerted when you save a file that has critical memories (bug fixes, corrections) associated with it.
